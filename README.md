Watch the project demo on YouTube:  https://youtu.be/eR0oJ0v-PkE


## Overview
This project implements a **deep learning-based brain tumor detection system** using **transfer learning with ResNet50**. The model classifies MRI scans into **four categories**: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor. It leverages advanced preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization techniques to improve robustness and reduce misclassification.
